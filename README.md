<H2>Project Title : Prediction of Late Deliveries for an e-commerce Supply Chain</H2>

This is the repository for all data, reports, slides and python notebooks related to the Second Capstone Project for the Springboard DataScience Course.<br>
This repository showcases a Supply Chain Data Science project that explores the real world sales data of a Supply Chain company for patterns and trends in sales & profits, product categories, logistics efficacy, fraudulent transactions and much more.<br>
The end goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict late deliveries using the transactional data available. Multiple classification models are compared in this regard and the best model is suggested for use.
