## Business Analytics and Late Delivery Prediction for an e-commerce Supply Chain

<p>This repository showcases a Supply Chain Data Science project that explores the real world sales data of a Supply Chain company for patterns and trends in sales and profits, product categories, logistics efficacy, fraudulent transactions and much more.</p>

<p>Customer satisfaction is the bread and butter of ecommerce businesses. It is the repeat business that is most beneficial to e-commerce businesses and leads to maximum profit since there are no new acquisition costs involved in repeat business.
Thus, prevention of customer churn, which is directly linked to customer satisfaction, is a key driver of a supply chain company's profitability.</p>

<p>Detecting late deliveries before they occur can greatly benefit the supply chain business by rerouting and taking proactive steps to ensure on-time delivery and can also set appropriate customer expectations in-terms of delivery time so that customers feel dissatisfied.</p>

A prediction algorithms for late deliveries will go a long way towards prevention of customer churn.<br>

The analysis in this notebook is aimed at providing solutions to the above problems and presents the following analysis:<br>
* Exploratory data analysis to detect trends in sales, product pricing and segments, markets and regions, and insights related to late delivery and fraudulent transactions
* Customer segmentation analysis using RFM technique providing a systematic approach to customer loyalty programs.
* A reliable machine Learning model that the company can deploy to detect late deliveries and facilitate customer satisfaction.

The end goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict late deliveries using the transactional data available. Multiple classification models are compared in this regard and the best model is suggested for use.
