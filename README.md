# Springboard-CapstoneTwo

Repository for all data, reports, slides and python notebooks related to the Second Capstone Project for the Springboard DataScience Course.
This repository focuses on a Supply Chain Data Science project that explores the sales data of a Supply Chain company and explores it for patterns and trends in sales & profits, product categories, logistics efficacy, fraudulent transactions and much more.
The end goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict late deliveries using the transactional data available. Multiple classification models are compared in this regard and the best model is suggested for use.
